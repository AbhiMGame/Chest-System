# Chest System
 
The Chest System Project is a robust and scalable solution designed to manage dynamic chest interactions in games. It employs advanced software design patterns, architectural principles, and game mechanics concepts, ensuring a clean and maintainable implementation

The Chest System Project is built using the MVC architecture, ensuring a clear separation of data, UI, and logic for better maintainability and scalability. It incorporates a State Machine to manage chest states such as "Closed," "Unlocking," and "Unlocked," providing smooth state transitions and predictable behavior. Additionally, the Observer Pattern is implemented through an Event System, allowing components to subscribe to events and react dynamically, promoting a decoupled and flexible design for easier future modifications and feature expansions.
